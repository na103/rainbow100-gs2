# Rainbow 100 Grahpics board.
this is a reverse engineering of a pretty rare graphics card for [Digital Rainbow 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_100)<br>

![alt text](https://github.com/na103/rainbow100-gs2/blob/main/img/Graphics.png "version V2")

has been remake thanks to [Tony Duell's](https://github.com/na103/rainbow100-gs2/blob/main/TonyDuell/graphics%205015687.pdf) schematics and some photos found on the web, the content of [GALs](https://github.com/na103/rainbow100-gs2/tree/main/gal) and [PROMs](https://github.com/na103/rainbow100-gs2/tree/main/prom) are grabbed from the original board.<br>
In repository you can  found kicad schematics of two version:<br>
V1 is like the original board while V2 version have some corrections, I removed bodge wire and replaces the DIP array resistor with more common SIP.
<br>
All needed component is in BOM file.

due to time and budget I haven't build and test it yet.<br> 
I share this my work, <b>completed but non tested</b>, eventualy useful for original board restore<br>
